    "security. Ballia’s toll could be high because of, as the team suspects, contaminated water, or because the \n",
    "local people could not cool themselves. Heat’s deadliness depends on an individual’s general well-being, \n",
    "acclimatisation, physical exertion, comorbidities, location, relative humidity, and extent of heat exposure. \n",

    "quickly as it accumulates. This can happen due to poor living conditions, adherence to caste- and gender-based \n",
